1. Map screen becomes slow when many photo markers load together due to lack of clustering and lazy loading.
2. App has no offline handling or network error feedback, causing silent failures during uploads.
3. Photo upload allows missing metadata (caption/tags), reducing event and content quality.
4. Upload progress UI is minimal and does not show percentage or retry options.
5. Gallery screens load all images at once, leading to performance issues (no pagination).
6. Backend APIs lack rate limiting, making the system vulnerable to spam uploads.
7. API responses are inconsistent across endpoints, complicating frontend handling.
8. No centralized error logging or monitoring is implemented on the backend.
9. Map location accuracy is not validated, causing incorrect photo placement.
10. Missing core features like photo filtering, likes/comments, and search reduce user engagement; these can be added via new routes, models, and UI screens.
